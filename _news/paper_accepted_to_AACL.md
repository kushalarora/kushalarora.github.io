## DIRECTOR: Generator-Classifiers For Supervised Language Modeling 

My recent work, DIRECTOR, a supervised learning architecture, was accepted at AACL, 2022. This work was done during internship at FAIR (Meta AI). 

In this work, proposed DIRECTOR architecture for supervised language modeling. The proposed architecture can exploit the negative examples for language modeling. We demonstrated that this method can be used to reduce the toxicity, contradiction, and repetition in language generation. 

Please see the paper and the repo below for more details.
