title: Research Internship with Borealis AI
---
This fall I will be interning with amazing [Layla El Asri](https://www.borealisai.com/en/team/layla-el-asri/) at Borealis AI's Montreal office. We will be working on quantifying exposure bias by posing language modeling as an imitation learning problem.

I wrapped up this intern in Feb, 2020 and we have submitted the paper to EMNLP. Email me for the preprint if you are interested.
