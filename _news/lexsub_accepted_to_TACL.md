title: LexSub accepted to TACL 
---

Our recent work in collaboration with [Aishik Chakraborty](http://aishikchakraborty.github.io/) and Prof. [Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/) was accepted to [Transactions of the ACL (TACL)](https://transacl.org/index.php/tacl). 

In this work, we proposed a novel framework to unify lexical and distributional semantics. We achieve this by learning lexical relations such as synonymy, hypernymy, and meronymy, in subspaces of the original distributional vector space. These subspaces can then be discovered by the downstream tasks relying on these pre-trained embeddings. More details and results are in the paper below.

ArXiv pre-print and the code coming  soon.
