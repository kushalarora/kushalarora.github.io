## The Stable Entropy Hypothesis and Entropy-Aware Decoding: An Analysis and Algorithm for Robust Natural Language Generation

Our latest work on analyzing degeneration in natural language generation through the lens of entropy of the conditional distribution of the model is now on ArXiv. 

In this work, we linked the entropy of the model under the choice of a decoding algorithm to its ability to produce "human-like" text. Building on this insight, we proposed an entropy-aware decoding algorithm that does not degenerate while acting greedily most of the time.
