Hey there! I am Kushal Arora.

I am a third year Ph.D. student at McGill and Mila. I am  jointly supervised by Prof. [Jackie Cheung](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html) and Prof. [Doina Precup](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/).

Before joining McGill, I was a software engineer at Amazon Alexa's Algorithms team. My work there focused on scaling distributed deep learning approaches for speech and language understanding.

Prior to that, I was a master student at University of Florida where I worked with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) on Compositional Language Modeling.

I am interested in treating language generation as a sequential decision-making problem. My research focuses at the intersection of language modeling and imitation learning. I am also interested in building and evaluating compositional representations for languages.

Thanks for visiting!
