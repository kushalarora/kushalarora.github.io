Hey there! I am Kushal Arora.

I am currently a first year Ph.D. student at McGill university under joint supervision of Prof. Doina Precup and Prof. Jackie Cheung. Before joining McGill I was a software engineer at Amazon working with Alexa's Algorithms team building a deep learning library and algorithms for internal use.

My research interest primarily lies in building a syntactically and semantically aware compositional representation for languages. I know this can be a mouthful and you can read more about it [here](/research_statement).


Thanks for visiting!
