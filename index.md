Hey there! I am Kushal Arora. I am currently a software engineer at Amazon, working with Alexa's Machine Learning Platform team on ASR and NLU modeling infrastructure. I also spend a part of my time on Alexa's Algorithm's team helping develop our in house deep learning library.

Before joining Amazon, I was a master's student at University of Florida's Department of Computer and Information Sciences with focus on Machine Learning. There I was working with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](http://cise.ufl.edu~anand) on my thesis titled Compositional Language Modeling. I have also spent a semester in Dr. [Daisy Wang](http://cise.ufl.edu/~daisyw)'s lab working on the problem of Ontology Alignment.

My research interest primarily lies in building a syntactically and semantically aware compositional representation of language. I know this can be mouthful and you can read more about it [here](/research).

I am looking for research positions starting Summer/Fall 2016 and would appreciate any leads in that regards.

Thanks for visiting!
