Hey there! I am Kushal Arora.

I am a first year Ph.D. student at [Reasoning and Learning Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/) at McGill. I am  jointly supervised by Prof. [Doina Precup](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/) and Prof. [Jackie Cheung](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html). 

Before joining McGill, I was a software engineer at Amazon Alexa's Algorithms. My work there mostly focused on scaling the deep learning approaches for speech and language understanding. Prior to that, I was a Master's student at University of Florida where I worked with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) on Compositional Language Modeling.

My research interest primarily lies in building a syntactically and semantically aware compositional representation for languages. I know this can be a mouthful and you can read more about it [here](/research_statement).


Thanks for visiting!
