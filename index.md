Hey there! I am Kushal Arora. I am currently a software engineer at Amazon, working with Alexa's Machine Learning Platform team on ASR and NLU modeling infrastructure.

Before joining Amazon, I was a master's student in Computer Science, with focus on Machine Learning, at University of Florida . There, I was working with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) on my thesis titled Compositional Language Modeling. I have also spent a semester in Dr. [Daisy Wang](http://dsr.cise.ufl.edu/daisyw/)'s lab working on the problem of Ontology Alignment.

My research interest primarily lies in building a syntactically and semantically aware compositional representation for languages. I know this can be mouthful and you can read more about it [here](/research_statement).


Thanks for visiting!
