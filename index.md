Hey there! I am Kushal Arora. I am currently a software engineer at Amazon. Here I am working with Alexa's Machine Learning Platform(MLP) team supporting model building and release for ASR and NLU. I also contribute on regular basis to Alexa's Algorithm's team helping develop our in house deep learning library.

Before joining Amazon, I was a MS(thesis) student at University of Florida's Computer Science department, working with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](http://cise.ufl.edu~anand) on Compositional Language Modeling. I have also spent a semester in Dr. [Daisy Wang](http://cise.ufl.edu/~daisyw)'s lab working on the problem of Ontology Alginment.

My research interest primarily lie in the area of learning unsupervised language representation and composition. I strongly believe a roboust representation can then be used to better current state of the art classifiers for many NLU tasks like sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, sentence completion, parsing to name a few. The assumption here is that most of the heavy lifting of building roboust features would already be taken care of by this representations and composition functions and a simple classification layer on top of this should be able to learn the weights better. I am also interested in problem of defining what a roboust representation means and metrics to evaluate these compositional frameworks and embeddings.

As this problem needs strong understanding of deep network training, I am also interested in optimization and regularization techniques for deep networks. I also believe the best way to look at this problem from manifold theory, hence, I am also interested in building on basics of manifold learning studied in Advanced Machine Learning class at University of Florida.

I am looking for research positions starting Summer/Fall 2016 and would appreciate any lead in that regards.

Thanks for reading!
