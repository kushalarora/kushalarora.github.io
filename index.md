Hey there! I am Kushal Arora.

I am currently a software engineer at Amazon, working with Alexa's Algorithms team. My team is responsible for developing machine learning libraries/algorithms used inside Amazon Alexa.

Before joining Amazon, I was a master's student in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at the University of Florida. There, I was working with Prof. [Anand Rangarajan](http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/) on my thesis titled Compositional Language Modeling. I have also spent a semester in Data Science Research lab supervised by Prof. [Daisy Wang](http://dsr.cise.ufl.edu/daisyw/)'s working on the problem of Ontology Alignment.

My research interest primarily lies in building a syntactically and semantically aware compositional representation for languages. I know this can be a mouthful and you can read more about it [here](/research_statement).


Thanks for visiting!
